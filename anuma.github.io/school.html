	School <br/>
	</h1>
	I completed my High Schooling from Carmel Convent Sr. Sec. School, BHEL Bhopal in 2014 (quite recently).
	The 14 years of my ,life, from my adolescence to teenage, were made worth in this fabulous institution where I earned all of my knowledge.
	Though at that time the routine felt like a most burdensome and tiring one, only after getting out of it I realised its worth.
